creating an app with electron

start with npm init
then npm i --save-dev electron

we then would say something like `npm start` to whit,
if at this temporal point we had not created `main.tsx` we would be at a loss

# npm init electron-app@latest my-new-app -- --template=webpack-typescript
# then npm start

# npm i -d @electron-forge/plugin-vite



adding electron forge to distribute our newly created app
`npm i -D @electron-forge/cli`
`npx electron-forge import`

creating the distributable with forge's `make` command
`npm run make`

then that goes to the `out` folder
